While Mac users were able to use the GWT compiler in previous versions, they couldn&#8217;t use GWT&#8217;s hosted browser to debug their web apps. WebKit has made it possible for Google to bring these development tools to the Mac, and, as a surprise Mac-only bonus, web developers using GWT get to use the <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/?p=41" title="Introducing the Web Inspector">Web Inspector</a>, too!

		<title>Optimizing Page Load Time (and a little about the Debug menu)</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>We don&#8217;t usually just repost content from other blogs here. But a lot of web developers seem to read this site, and those of us who work on WebKit are totally into loading web pages as fast as possible. With that in mind, here&#8217;s a great article on <a href="http://www.die.net/musings/page_load_time/">Optimizing Page Load Time</a>. I recommend reading and applying much of the advice here. However, I&#8217;ll note that we have experimented with using HTTP pipelining for Safari in the past, too many major servers gave garbage results in the face of it. While we may periodically re-evaluate this, we are not holding back on it out of spite or anything.</p>
	<p>Another tip you might find handy as a web developer is the &#8220;Show Page Load Test Window&#8221; option in the Safari Debug menu. You can turn on the Debug menu by typing <code>defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDebugMenu YES</code> at a shell prompt, and then restarting Safari. This menu includes a number of rough debugging tools that we created mainly for browser testing, but you may find some of them handy for web development. The page load test in particular is interesting because it measures page load time in a more precise way than either onload timing or just using a stopwatch. If you change the &#8220;Suite&#8221; pop-up menu to &#8220;URL&#8221;, you can type the URL of your choice and get a fairly precise time for loading it. If you empty the cache first, you can get an uncached time.</p>
	<p>I recommend trying this a couple of times as you test your site. We&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s a lot easier to improve performance when you have a precise way to measure it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>I was pointed to this article about <a href="http://regex.info/blog/photo-tech/color-spaces-page3">color spaces in Web browsers</a>.  The ultimate point of the article, that it would be good for a Web browser to be &#8220;Color Smart&#8221;, i.e., to support not only embedded color profiles in images but also to correct unprofiled images to sRGB is a sound one.  However, the author takes a few potshots at Web browsers on the Mac, and I thought I&#8217;d respond to make it clear what the technical hurdles are with this problem.</p>
	<p>First of all, if you correct unprofiled images to sRGB, you have to correct all drawing to sRGB.  This includes everything drawn by CSS (borders, backgrounds, text).  This is not difficult to do under the hood, although it is difficult to do it with no performance regression in our benchmarks at all.  In fact we even tried this during the Tiger development cycle (just correcting everything drawn to sRGB), but it slowed us down.</p>
	<p>The big hurdle that we ran into, though, was with the drawing we did not control, namely the Flash plug-in.  The problem is that designers specify colors in Flash and colors in CSS in the Web page, and they expect those colors to match.  Because Flash&#8217;s drawing isn&#8217;t correcting to sRGB, if we did it in Safari, there would be color mismatches all over the place.  These mismatches look far worse than if we just don&#8217;t correct at all.</p>
	<p>(This mismatch with plug-ins is presumably the reason that this feature was not enabled by default in Mac IE.)</p>
